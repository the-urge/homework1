What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge is a non destructive way of combining multiple 'histories' of a repo in git. It has the repo histories all lead to the same commit, but does not destroy
any individual lineages, so all previous versions can still be easily accessed. This can lead to a polluted history. A rebase is more destructive
but also more definitive. It sets all branches to the current commit, effectively erasing all other lineages. This cleans up the history a lot but
can make collaboration harder.
